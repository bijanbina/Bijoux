Bug Fixing
===============================
1. gsetting key load failed
if you already reset the key and it doesn't take effect there is a good possibility that there is 
outher key in some other directory that the defaults. In this case it's in /usr/local/share/glib/schematic
to fix this remove or recompile from the source

2. Gnome is very slow
This is due to low cpu frequency by running
cpupower -c 1 frequency-set -d 2.5GHz
get very fast. Fortunately this does not produce much heat 
("thanks to mosfet capacitance")
